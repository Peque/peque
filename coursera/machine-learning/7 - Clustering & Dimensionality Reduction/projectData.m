%PROJECTDATA Computes the reduced data representation when projecting only
%on to the top k eigenvectors
%   Z = projectData(X, U, K) computes the projection of
%   the normalized inputs X into the reduced dimensional space spanned by
%   the first K columns of U. It returns the projected examples in Z.

function Z = projectData(X, U, K)

	Z = X * U(:, 1:K);
